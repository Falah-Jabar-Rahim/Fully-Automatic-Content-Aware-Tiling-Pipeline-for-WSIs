# Fully Automatic Content-Aware Tiling Pipeline for Whole Slide Images 
![WSI-QA](./WSI-QA.bmp)
# Abstract: 
TBD.
# Setting Up the Pipeline:
1. System requirements:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
- CUDA version: 12.2
- Python version: 3.9 (using conda environments)
- Anaconda version 23.7.4

2. Steps to Set Up the Pipeline:
- Download the pipeline to your Desktop
- Navigate to the downloaded pipeline folder
- Right-click within the pipeline folder and select `Open Terminal`
- Create a conda environment:
```bash
  conda create -n WSISmartTiling python=3.9
```
- Activate the environment:
```bash
  conda activate WSISmartTiling
```
- Install required packages:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Datasets:

- Contact the corresponding author to access the datasets described in the paper
- The datasets (only tiles and segmentation masks) are available for research purposes only

# Pretrained Weights:

TBD.

# Inference:

- Place your Whole Slide Image (WSI) into the `test_wsi` folder
- The pre-trained weights are provided in `pretrained_ckpt` folder
- In the terminal execute:
```bash
  python test_wsi.py
```
- After running the inference, you will obtain the following outputs in `test_wsi` folder:
  - A thumbnail image of WSI
  - A thumbnail image of WSI with regions of interest (ROI) identified
  - A segmentation mask highlighting segmented regions of the WSI
  - A segmentation mask highlighting only qualified tissue regions of the WSI [background:0, qualified tissue:255]
  - Excel files contain statistics on identified artifacts
  - A folder named `Selected_tiles` containing qualified tiles
- If your WSI image has a format other than .svs or .mrxs, please modify line 92 in `test_wsi.py`
- It is recommended to use a tile size of 270 Ã— 270 pixels
- To generate tiles of different sizes (e.g., 512x512):
    - Run the pipeline to generate the qualified tissue mask
    - Use the qualified tissue mask and the WSI to generate tiles of the desired size (a Python script will be provided soon to do this)
- If your WSI image contains pen-markings other than red, blue, green, or black, please update the pens.py file (located in the wsi_tile_cleanup/filters folder) to handle any additional pen-markings
- To generate a high-resolution thumbnail image and segmentation masks, you can adjust the `thumbnail_size` parameter in `inti_artifact.py`. However, note that this will increase the execution time
- Check out the useful parameters on line 58 of `inti_artifact.py` and adjust them if needed


# Training:

- To retrain the artifact detection model, refer to the details provided in:  [GitHub](https://github.com/Falah-Jabar-Rahim/A-Fully-Automatic-DL-Pipeline-for-WSI-QA)
- To retrain the ink removal detection model, refer to the details provided in: [GitHub](https://github.com/Vishwesh4/Ink-WSI)

# Results

# Notes:

- If your WSIs do not contain pen-marking artifacts, you can also use this pipeline:  [GitHub](https://github.com/Falah-Jabar-Rahim/A-Fully-Automatic-DL-Pipeline-for-WSI-QA)
- WSI-SmartTiling is designed to clean and prepare WSIs for deep learning model development, prioritizing performance over efficiency


# Acknowledgment:

Some parts of this pipeline were adapted from work on [GitHub](https://github.com/pengsl-lab/DHUnet) and  [GitHub](https://github.com/Vishwesh4/Ink-WSI). If you use this pipeline, please make sure to cite their work properly
